              <p>
                I am excited to welcome you to evergreen schools. By working
                hard, we have continued to blaze the trail in the delivery of
                quality education these past years and have set enviable
                standards. Evergreen schools is unique because we believe in
                child centred learning. This philosophy sets the child free to
                explore and learn in an atmosphere of compassion, mutual respect
                and trust.
              </p>

              <p>
                Small class size, supportive staff, a working system which
                recognizes and promotes the individuality of the child, allows
                each child to develop his/her talent. We have come to realize
                that children have different aptitudes and that they learn and
                develop at different stages. It is important to allow them
              </p>
              <p>
                Our rich curriculum which encompasses the best of British and
                Nigerian contents, empowers the child to flow freely with the
                dynamics of a globalized world. We work with the aim of raising
                independent thinkers who are open to ideas, inquisitive,
                confident, kind and responsible, with an enduring love for
                learning and a purposeful future. Our pupils graduate from
                evergreen schools with excellent grades ,and with the freedom
                that comes from knowing that they are valued by staff and their
                peers, they move on to highly rated secondary school in Nigeria,
                ready to soar. This is the freedom we create and celebrate in
                the education we impart in them. While they were here, they
                received the best and as they leave, we believe they will always
                strive for the best.
              </p>
              <p>
                Back to you my dear children; be optimistic that you can join
                the team of achievers that both Nigeria and the world have ever
                received; it may not be easy, but it is possible. As you have
                come to be part of Evergreen School family, try to be good Ambassadors of
                this great citadel of learning obey the school rules and
                regulations, be punctual, attentive and open. Once again you are
                highly welcome and remain blessed.
